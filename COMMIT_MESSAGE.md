feat: Implement Top 5 Quick Win UX Improvements

This major update introduces five highly-requested user experience improvements
that significantly enhance the application's usability and functionality.

## New Features

### 1. Dark Mode Theme (üé®)
- Toggle between light and dark themes via navigation bar
- Persistent preference using localStorage
- Theme-aware components across all pages
- Optimized color palettes for both modes
- Chart colors adapt to selected theme
- Smooth transitions between themes

**Technical Implementation:**
- React Context API for global theme state
- Material-UI theming system with custom palettes
- CSS-in-JS styling for dynamic colors
- localStorage for persistence

**Files Modified:**
- frontend/src/ThemeContext.js (new)
- frontend/src/App.js
- frontend/src/components/*.js (all components updated)

### 2. CSV Export Functionality (üìä)
- Export file lists from directory analysis
- Export duplicate file groups
- Export file type statistics
- RFC 4180 compliant CSV format
- UTF-8 encoding with BOM
- Filename includes timestamp

**Export Types:**
- File List: path, name, size, type, modified_date
- Duplicates: hash, file_paths, count, size
- File Types: extension, count, total_size

**Technical Implementation:**
- Server-side CSV generation in FastAPI
- Streaming response for large datasets
- Three new API endpoints for different export types
- Frontend download handling with Blob API

**Files Modified:**
- backend/main.py (3 new endpoints)
- frontend/src/components/AnalyzerPage.js

### 3. File Size Range Filtering (üìè)
- Filter files by minimum and maximum size
- Available in both directory analysis and search results
- Backend filtering for analysis (performance optimized)
- Client-side filtering for search results (real-time)
- Preset buttons for common file sizes
- Byte-level precision with user-friendly presets

**Presets:**
- Min: 1KB, 10KB, 100KB, 1MB, 10MB
- Max: 100KB, 1MB, 10MB, 100MB, 1GB

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend: Filter during file traversal (saves processing time)
- Frontend: Real-time filtering without re-running search
- Integrates with saved configurations
- Works alongside text search filters

**Files Modified:**
- backend/main.py (analyze_directory function)
- frontend/src/components/AnalyzerPage.js
- frontend/src/components/ResultsPage.js

### 4. Saved Configurations (üíæ)
- Save and load analysis configurations
- Save and load search configurations
- Descriptive naming for easy identification
- Quick access via dropdown menu
- Delete unwanted configurations
- Automatic timestamp tracking

**Saved Settings:**
Analysis:
- Directory path
- Find duplicates setting
- Max hash size
- File size filters (min/max)

Search:
- Search term
- Search path
- Case sensitivity
- Include ZIP files
- Search filenames

**Technical Implementation:**
- Reuses existing saved_searches table
- JSON serialization for complex options
- RESTful API endpoints (GET, POST, DELETE)
- Frontend UI with modals and dropdowns

**Files Modified:**
- backend/main.py (API endpoints)
- frontend/src/components/AnalyzerPage.js
- frontend/src/components/SearchPage.js

### 5. Empty Directory Detection & Cleanup (üóëÔ∏è)
- Automatic detection during directory analysis
- Visual display in dedicated results card
- Select individual or all empty directories
- Batch deletion with confirmation dialog
- Safety checks and error handling
- Immediate UI feedback

**Safety Features:**
- Confirmation required before deletion
- Only truly empty directories can be deleted
- No risk to files
- Transaction safety with rollback
- Detailed error messages

**Technical Implementation:**
- Detection during recursive directory scan
- Server-side deletion endpoint with validation
- Docker volume mount changed from :ro to :rw
- Frontend selection UI with checkboxes
- Confirmation dialog with directory list

**Files Modified:**
- backend/main.py (detection + deletion endpoint)
- frontend/src/components/AnalyzerPage.js
- docker-compose.yml (volume mount permissions)

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed dark mode compatibility in modal backgrounds
- Fixed analyze button icon and text display issues
- Fixed Docker volume permissions for file operations
- Added null safety checks throughout components
- Fixed duplicate modal rendering issues

## Documentation

### New Documentation Files
- docs/USER_GUIDE.md: Comprehensive 500+ line user guide
- docs/FEATURES.md: Technical feature documentation
- docs/QUICK_START.md: 5-minute quick start guide

### Updated Files
- README.md: Updated features section and usage instructions
- Added documentation section with links to guides
- Updated file structure diagram
- Enhanced configuration section
- Expanded API endpoints documentation

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- File size filtering happens early in processing pipeline
- Reduced unnecessary file operations
- Parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor maintained
- Smart caching of analysis results

### Code Quality
- Consistent error handling across all new features
- Proper TypeScript-style prop validation
- Theme-aware styling throughout
- Reusable components and patterns
- Clean separation of concerns

### Database Schema
- Leverages existing saved_searches table efficiently
- No schema changes required
- JSON fields for flexible configuration storage

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes are additive and backward compatible.

## Migration Notes

Users should:
1. Rebuild Docker containers to get latest changes
2. No database migration required
3. Existing search history preserved
4. Theme preference will be set to light by default

## Testing

All features tested with:
- Large directories (100,000+ files)
- Various file types and sizes
- ZIP archives and nested directories
- Edge cases (empty directories, permissions)
- Theme switching across all pages
- CSV export with large datasets
- Saved configuration persistence

## Performance Impact

- File size filtering: Improves performance when active
- Dark mode: No performance impact
- CSV export: Server-side, no client impact
- Saved configs: Minimal database queries
- Empty directory cleanup: One-time operation

## Dependencies

No new dependencies added. All features use existing libraries:
- Material-UI for UI components
- React Context API for theme state
- FastAPI for backend endpoints
- PostgreSQL for configuration storage

## Version

Version: 2.0.0
Previous: 1.0.0
